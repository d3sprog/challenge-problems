abstract = {Groupware systems are computer-based systems that support two or more users engaged
in a common task, and that provide an interface to a shared environment. These systems
frequently require fine-granularity sharing of data and fast response times. This
paper distinguishes real-time groupware systems from other multi-user systems and
discusses their concurrency control requirements. An algorithm for concurrency control
in real-time groupware systems is then presented. The advantages of this algorithm
are its simplicity of use and its responsiveness: users can operate directly on the
data without obtaining locks. The algorithm must know some semantics of the operations.
However the algorithm's overall structure is independent of the semantic information,
allowing the algorithm to be adapted to many situations. An example application of
the algorithm to group text editing is given, along with a sketch of its proof of
correctness in this particular case. We note that the behavior desired in many of
these systems is non-serializable.},

  abstract   = { Git is a widely used version control system that is powerful but complicated. Its
complexity may not be an inevitable consequence of its power but rather evidence of
flaws in its design. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed the design of Git using
a theory that identifies concepts, purposes, and misfits. Some well-known difficulties
with Git are described, and explained as misfits in which underlying concepts fail
to meet their intended purpose. Based on this analysis, we designed a reworking of
Git (called Gitless) that attempts to remedy these flaws.  To correlate misfits with
issues reported by users, we conducted a study of Stack Overflow questions. And to
determine whether users experienced fewer complications using Gitless in place of
Git, we conducted a small user study. Results suggest our approach can be profitable
in identifying, analyzing, and fixing design problems. },

we studied data scientists who program, often with small scripts, to experiment with
data. These studies show that data scientists frequently code new analysis ideas by
building off of their code from a previous idea. They often rely on informal versioning
interactions like copying code, keeping unused code, and commenting out code to repurpose
older analysis code while attempting to keep those older analyses intact. Unlike conventional
version control, these informal practices allow for fast versioning of any size code
snippet, and quick comparisons by interchanging which versions are run. However, data
scientists must maintain a strong mental map of their code in order to distinguish
versions, leading to errors and confusion. We explore the needs for improving version
control tools for exploratory tasks, and demonstrate a tool for lightweight local
versioning, called Variolite, which programmers found usable and desirable in a preliminary
usability study.},

It builds on the literate computing approach, commonly found in interactive notebooks

in the same document. However, literate computing in interactive notebooks are limited
to computation and it is challenging to extend their user interface, reprogram their
functionality, or develop stand-alone applications. Codestrates builds literate computing
capabilities on top of Webstrates and demonstrates how it can be used for (i) collaborative
interactive notebooks, (ii) extending its functionality from within itself, and (iii)
developing reprogrammable applications.},

abstract = {Block-based programming systems, such as Scratch or Alice, are the most popular environments
for introducing young children to programming. However, mastery of text-based programming
continues to be the educational goal for students who continue to program into their
teenage years and beyond. Transitioning across the significant gap between the two
editing styles presents a difficult challenge in school-level teaching of programming.
We propose a new style of program manipulation to bridge the gap: frame-based editing.
Frame-based editing has the resistance to errors and approachability of block-based
programming while retaining the flexibility and more conventional programming semantics
of text-based programming languages. In this paper, we analyse the issues involved
in the transition from blocks to text and argue that they can be overcome by using
frame-based editing as an intermediate step. A design and implementation of a frame-based
editor is provided.},

Changes introduced in a model may trigger inconsistencies between the model and its run-time state (e.g., deleting the current state in a statemachine); effectively requiring to migrate the run-time state to comply with the updated model. In this paper, we introduce an approach that enables to automatically migrate such run-time state based on declarative constraints defined by the language designer. We illustrate the approach using Nextep, a meta-modeling language for defining invariants and migration constraints on run-time state models. When a model changes, Nextep employs model finding techniques, backed by a solver, to automatically infer a new run-time model that satisfies the declared constraints. We apply Nextep to define migration strategies for two DSLs, and report on its expressiveness and performance.},

  abstract  = {Representing programs as text strings makes programming harder then it has to be.
The source text of a program is far removed from its behavior. Bridging this conceptual
gulf is what makes programming so inhumanly difficult -- we are not compilers. Subtext
is a new medium in which the representation of a program is the same thing as its
execution. Like a spreadsheet, a program is visible and alive, constantly executing
even as it is edited. Program edits are coherent semantic transformations.The essence
of this new medium is copying. Programs are constructed by copying and executed by
copy flow: the projection of changes through copies. The simple idea of copying develops
into a rich theory of higher-order continual copying of trees. Notably absent are
symbolic names, the workhorse of textual notation, replaced by immediately-bound explicit
relationships. Subtext unifies traditionally distinct programming tools and concepts,
and enables some novel ones. Ancestral structures are a new primitive data type that
combines the features of lists and records, along with unproblematic multiple inheritance.
Adaptive conditionals use first-class program edits to dynamically adapt behavior.A
prototype implementation shows promise, but calls for much further research. Subtext
suggests that we can make programming radically easier, if we are willing to be radical.},

this article, a consistency model, with properties of convergence, causality preservation,

in real-time cooperative editing systems. Moreover, an integrated set of schemes and
algorithms, which support the proposed consistency model, are devised and discussed
in detail. In particular, we have contributed (1) a novel generic operation transformation
control algorithm for achieving intention preservation in combination with schemes
for achieving convergence and causality preservation and (2) a pair of reversible
inclusion and exclusion transformation algorithms for stringwise operations for text

@article{vanRozen19,
	abstract = {Live programming is a style of development characterized by incremental change and immediate feedback. Instead of long edit-compile cycles, developers modify a running program by changing its source code, receiving immediate feedback as it instantly adapts in response. In this paper, we propose an approach to bridge the gap between running programs and textual domain-specific languages (DSLs). The first step of our approach consists of applying a novel model differencing algorithm, tmdiff, to the textual DSL code. By leveraging ordinary text differencing and origin tracking, tmdiff produces deltas defined in terms of the metamodel of a language. In the second step of our approach, the model deltas are applied at run time to update a running system, without having to restart it. Since the model deltas are derived from the static source code of the program, they are unaware of any run-time state maintained during model execution. We therefore propose a generic, dynamic patch architecture, rmpatch, which can be customized to cater for domain-specific state migration. We illustrate rmpatch in a case study of a live programming environment for a simple DSL implemented in Rascal for simultaneously defining and executing state machines.},

  abstract  = {Model management is a generic approach to solving problems of data programmability where precisely engineered mappings are required. Applications include data warehousing, e-commerce, object-to-relational wrappers, enterprise information integration, database portals, and report generators. The goal is to develop a model management engine that can support tools for all of these applications. The engine supports operations to match schemas, compose mappings, diff schemas, merge schemas, translate schemas into different data models, and generate data transformations from mappings.Much has been learned about model management since it was proposed seven years ago. This leads us to a revised vision that differs from the original in two main respects: the operations must handle more expressive mappings, and the runtime that executes mappings should be added as an important model management component. We review what has been learned from recent experience, explain the revised model management vision based on that experience, and identify the research problems that the revised vision opens up.},

We conclude that a new generation of schema evolution benchmarks is called for, which reflect these new demands, especially in the context of schema evolution in NoSQL data stores.},

  abstract   = {Supporting graceful schema evolution represents an unsolved problem for traditional information systems that is further exacerbated in web information systems, such as Wikipedia and public scientific databases: in these projects based on multiparty cooperation the frequency of database schema changes has increased while tolerance for downtimes has nearly disappeared. As of today, schema evolution remains an error-prone and time-consuming undertaking, because the DB Administrator (DBA) lacks the methods and tools needed to manage and automate this endeavor by (i) predicting and evaluating the effects of the proposed schema changes, (ii) rewriting queries and applications to operate on the new schema, and (iii) migrating the database.Our PRISM system takes a big first step toward addressing this pressing need by providing: (i) a language of Schema Modification Operators to express concisely complex schema changes, (ii) tools that allow the DBA to evaluate the effects of such changes, (iii) optimized translation of old queries to work on the new schema version, (iv) automatic data migration, and (v) full documentation of intervened changes as needed to support data provenance, database flash back, and historical queries. PRISM solves these problems by integrating recent theoretical advances on mapping composition and invertibility, into a design that also achieves usability and scalability. Wikipedia and its 170+ schema versions provided an invaluable testbed for validating PRISM tools and their ability to support legacy queries.},

Data, already existing in a running product, needs to be evolved accordingly, usually by manually written SQL scripts. A promising approach in database research is to use a declarative database evolution language, which couples both schema and data evolution into intuitive operations. Existing database evolution languages focus on usability but did not aim for completeness. However, this is an inevitable prerequisite for reasonable database evolution to avoid complex and error-prone workarounds. We argue that relational completeness is the feasible expressiveness for a database evolution language. Building upon an existing language, we introduce CoDEL. We define its semantic using relational algebra, propose a syntax, and show its relational completeness.},

  abstract  = {Requirements for software applications change almost continuously in all phases of the product life cycle, which leads to a constant adaption of software systems. These changes affect the domain model of the application and usually lead to necessary changes of the underlying database. As a result, the data stored in this database must also be adapted accordingly. This well-known problem is called schema evolution. Manual schema evolution with low-level SQL scripts contains both time-consuming and error-prone routine tasks and complicated operations that require expert knowledge. Automation promises significant leverage for cost savings and quality improvements. To date, the most advanced solutions for this problem have focused on operator-based approaches. However, these approaches do not allow free editing of the database schema, but require the database administrator to know in advance the exact sequence of all required operations. In this paper, we present EvolveDB, an approach to model-driven schema evolution in relational databases, where the user specifies the evolution steps by freely editing a database model extracted by reverse engineering. EvolveDB analyzes the differences between the status quo and the evolved model structures and generates a data migration script. An initial evaluation with experts shows promising results. A screencast of the demo is available at https://youtu.be/ieXmrDd2nw4.},

Effective support for schema evolution is challenging since schema changes may have to be propagated, correctly and efficiently, to instance data and dependent schemas, mappings, or applications. We introduce the major requirements for effective schema and ontology evolution, including support for a rich set of change operations, simplicity of change specification, evolution transparency (e.g., by providing and maintaining views or schema versions), automated generation of evolution mappings, and predictable instance migration that minimizes data loss and manual intervention. We then give an overview about the current state of the art and recent research results for the evolution of relational schemas, XML schemas, and ontologies. For numerous approaches, we outline how and to what degree they meet the introduced requirements.},
