  abstract  = {Data integration is the problem of combining data residing at different sources, and providing the user with a unified view of these data. The problem of designing data integration systems is important in current real world applications, and is characterized by a number of issues that are interesting from a theoretical point of view. This document presents on overview of the material to be presented in a tutorial on data integration. The tutorial is focused on some of the theoretical issues that are relevant for data integration. Special attention will be devoted to the following aspects: modeling a data integration application, processing queries in data integration, dealing with inconsistent data sources, and reasoning on queries.},

  abstract  = {A schema mapping is a specification of the relationship between a source schema and a target schema. Schema mappings are fundamental building blocks in data integration and data exchange and, as such, obtaining the right schema mapping constitutes a major step towards the integration or exchange of data. Up to now, schema mappings have typically been specified manually or have been derived using mapping-design systems that automatically generate a schema mapping from a visual specification of the relationship between two schemas. We present a novel paradigm and develop a system for the interactive design of schema mappings via data examples. Each data example represents a partial specification of the semantics of the desired schema mapping. At the core of our system lies a sound and complete algorithm that, given a finite set of data examples, decides whether or not there exists a GLAV schema mapping (i.e., a schema mapping specified by Global-and-Local-As-View constraints) that "fits" these data examples. If such a fitting GLAV schema mapping exists, then our system constructs the "most general" one. We give a rigorous computational complexity analysis of the underlying decision problem concerning the existence of a fitting GLAV schema mapping, given a set of data examples. Specifically, we prove that this problem is complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, hence, in a precise sense, harder than NP-complete. This worst-case complexity analysis notwithstanding, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our prototype implementation that demonstrates the feasibility of interactively designing schema mappings using data examples. In particular, our experiments show that our system achieves very good performance in real-life scenarios.},

  abstract   = {A database view is a portion of the data structured in a way suitable to a specific application. Updates on views must be translated into updates on the underlying database. This paper studies the translation process in the relational model.The procedure is as follows: first, a “complete” set of updates is defined such that
                together with every update the set contains a “return” update, that is, one that brings the view back to the original state;given two updates in the set, their composition is also in the set.To translate a complete set, we define a mapping called a “translator,” that associates with each view update a unique database update called a “translation.” The constraint on a translation is to take the database to a state mapping onto the updated view. The constraint on the translator is to be a morphism.We propose a method for defining translators. Together with the user-defined view, we define a “complementary” view such that the database could be computed from the view and its complement. We show that a view can have many different complements and that the choice of a complement determines an update policy. Thus, we fix a view complement and we define the translation of a given view update in such a way that the complement remains invariant (“translation under constant complement”). The main result of the paper states that, given a complete set U of view updates, U has a translator if and only if U is translatable under constant complement.},

It is demonstrated here that this is entirely possible in Haskell, by faithfully following the motto of live coding: "Change the program, keep the state."  With generic programming, one easily arrives at an automatic state migration function. The approach can be generalised to an arrowized Functional Reactive Programming framework that is parametrized by its side effects. It allows for building up complete live programs from reusable, modular components, and to separate data flow cleanly from control flow. Useful utilities for debugging and quickchecking are presented.},

The core of the system consists of a combinator library for composing type-changing rewrite rules that preserve structural information and referential constraints. We discuss the implementation of the system's core library, and of its SQL and XML front-ends in the functional language Haskell. We show how the system can be used to tackle various two-level transformation scenarios, such as XML schema evolution coupled with document migration, and hierarchical-relational data mappings that convert between XML documents and SQL databases.},

Applications include data warehousing, e-commerce, object-to-relational wrappers, enterprise information integration, database portals, and report generators. The goal is to develop a model management engine that can support tools for all of these applications. The engine supports operations to match schemas, compose mappings, diff schemas, merge schemas, translate schemas into different data models, and generate data transformations from mappings.Much has been learned about model management since it was proposed seven years ago. This leads us to a revised vision that differs from the original in two main respects: the operations must handle more expressive mappings, and the runtime that executes mappings should be added as an important model management component. We review what has been learned from recent experience, explain the revised model management vision based on that experience, and identify the research problems that the revised vision opens up.},

  abstract  = {Model-Driven Engineering aims at shifting the focus of software development from coding to modelling in order to reduce the complexity of realizing nowadays applications. In this respect, models are expected to evolve due to refinements, improvements, bug fixes, and so forth. Because of the same reasons, also modelling languages (i.e. metamodels) are expected to be changed, even though at a different speed if compared to models. The relevant corpus of research grown up in the latest years and dealing with both these problems considers them as separate events; however, in normal practice not all the models are migrated instantaneously due to a metamodel adaptation, rather the co-adaptation is required when commits are attempted from a local workspace to the model repository, which can demand for different management policies.This paper illustrates the challenges arising in coping with concurrent metamodel and model versioning. In particular, it details a set of desired behaviours among which the user would usually select the appropriate management for the scenario into consideration together with entailed problems. Moreover, the work proposes corresponding solutions and discusses open issues.},

  abstract   = {Supporting graceful schema evolution represents an unsolved problem for traditional information systems that is further exacerbated in web information systems, such as Wikipedia and public scientific databases: in these projects based on multiparty cooperation the frequency of database schema changes has increased while tolerance for downtimes has nearly disappeared. As of today, schema evolution remains an error-prone and time-consuming undertaking, because the DB Administrator (DBA) lacks the methods and tools needed to manage and automate this endeavor by (i) predicting and evaluating the effects of the proposed schema changes, (ii) rewriting queries and applications to operate on the new schema, and (iii) migrating the database.Our PRISM system takes a big first step toward addressing this pressing need by providing: (i) a language of Schema Modification Operators to express concisely complex schema changes, (ii) tools that allow the DBA to evaluate the effects of such changes, (iii) optimized translation of old queries to work on the new schema version, (iv) automatic data migration, and (v) full documentation of intervened changes as needed to support data provenance, database flash back, and historical queries. PRISM solves these problems by integrating recent theoretical advances on mapping composition and invertibility, into a design that also achieves usability and scalability. Wikipedia and its 170+ schema versions provided an invaluable testbed for validating PRISM tools and their ability to support legacy queries.},

abstract = {Groupware systems are computer-based systems that support two or more users engaged
in a common task, and that provide an interface to a shared environment. These systems
frequently require fine-granularity sharing of data and fast response times. This
paper distinguishes real-time groupware systems from other multi-user systems and
discusses their concurrency control requirements. An algorithm for concurrency control
in real-time groupware systems is then presented. The advantages of this algorithm
are its simplicity of use and its responsiveness: users can operate directly on the
data without obtaining locks. The algorithm must know some semantics of the operations.
However the algorithm's overall structure is independent of the semantic information,
allowing the algorithm to be adapted to many situations. An example application of
the algorithm to group text editing is given, along with a sketch of its proof of
correctness in this particular case. We note that the behavior desired in many of
these systems is non-serializable.},

  abstract  = {Requirements for software applications change almost continuously in all phases of the product life cycle, which leads to a constant adaption of software systems. These changes affect the domain model of the application and usually lead to necessary changes of the underlying database. As a result, the data stored in this database must also be adapted accordingly. This well-known problem is called schema evolution. Manual schema evolution with low-level SQL scripts contains both time-consuming and error-prone routine tasks and complicated operations that require expert knowledge. Automation promises significant leverage for cost savings and quality improvements. To date, the most advanced solutions for this problem have focused on operator-based approaches. However, these approaches do not allow free editing of the database schema, but require the database administrator to know in advance the exact sequence of all required operations. In this paper, we present EvolveDB, an approach to model-driven schema evolution in relational databases, where the user specifies the evolution steps by freely editing a database model extracted by reverse engineering. EvolveDB analyzes the differences between the status quo and the evolved model structures and generates a data migration script. An initial evaluation with experts shows promising results. A screencast of the demo is available at https://youtu.be/ieXmrDd2nw4.},

Effective support for schema evolution is challenging since schema changes may have to be propagated, correctly and efficiently, to instance data and dependent schemas, mappings, or applications. We introduce the major requirements for effective schema and ontology evolution, including support for a rich set of change operations, simplicity of change specification, evolution transparency (e.g., by providing and maintaining views or schema versions), automated generation of evolution mappings, and predictable instance migration that minimizes data loss and manual intervention. We then give an overview about the current state of the art and recent research results for the evolution of relational schemas, XML schemas, and ontologies. For numerous approaches, we outline how and to what degree they meet the introduced requirements.},

Data, already existing in a running product, needs to be evolved accordingly, usually by manually written SQL scripts. A promising approach in database research is to use a declarative database evolution language, which couples both schema and data evolution into intuitive operations. Existing database evolution languages focus on usability but did not aim for completeness. However, this is an inevitable prerequisite for reasonable database evolution to avoid complex and error-prone workarounds. We argue that relational completeness is the feasible expressiveness for a database evolution language. Building upon an existing language, we introduce CoDEL. We define its semantic using relational algebra, propose a syntax, and show its relational completeness.},

Manual migration of these models in response to metamodel evolution is tedious and error-prone. To significantly automate model migration, operator-based approaches provide reusable coupled operators that encapsulate both metamodel evolution and model migration. The success of an operator-based approach highly depends on the library of reusable coupled operators it provides. In this paper, we thus present an extensive catalog of coupled operators that is based both on a literature survey as well as real-life case studies. The catalog is organized according to a number of criteria to ease assessing the impact on models as well as selecting the right operator for a metamodel change at hand.},

  abstract   = {Coupled transformation occurs when multiple software artifacts must be transformed in such a way that they remain consistent with each other. For instance, when a database schema is adapted in the context of system maintenance, the persistent data residing in the system's database needs to be migrated to conform to the adapted schema. Also, queries embedded in the application code and any declared referential constraints must be adapted to take the schema changes into account. As another example, in XML-to-relational data mapping, a hierarchical XML Schema is mapped to a relational SQL schema with appropriate referential constraints, and the XML documents and queries are converted into relational data and relational queries. The 2LT project is aimed at providing a formal basis for coupled transformation. This formal basis is found in data refinement theory, point-free program calculation, and strategic term rewriting. We formalize the coupled transformation of a data type by an algebra of information-preserving data refinement steps, each witnessed by appropriate data conversion functions. Refinement steps are modeled by so-called two-level rewrite rules on type expressions that synthesize conversion functions between redex and reduct while rewriting. Strategy combinators are used to composed two-level rewrite rules into complete rewrite systems. Point-free program calculation is applied to optimized synthesize conversion function, to migrate queries, and to normalize data type constraints. In this paper, we provide an overview of the challenges met by the 2LT project and we give a sketch of the solutions offered.},

  abstract  = {How do people ideate through code? Using semi-structured interviews and a survey,
we studied data scientists who program, often with small scripts, to experiment with
data. These studies show that data scientists frequently code new analysis ideas by
building off of their code from a previous idea. They often rely on informal versioning
interactions like copying code, keeping unused code, and commenting out code to repurpose
older analysis code while attempting to keep those older analyses intact. Unlike conventional
version control, these informal practices allow for fast versioning of any size code
snippet, and quick comparisons by interchanging which versions are run. However, data
scientists must maintain a strong mental map of their code in order to distinguish
versions, leading to errors and confusion. We explore the needs for improving version
control tools for exploratory tasks, and demonstrate a tool for lightweight local
versioning, called Variolite, which programmers found usable and desirable in a preliminary
usability study.},

It builds on the literate computing approach, commonly found in interactive notebooks

in the same document. However, literate computing in interactive notebooks are limited
to computation and it is challenging to extend their user interface, reprogram their
functionality, or develop stand-alone applications. Codestrates builds literate computing
capabilities on top of Webstrates and demonstrates how it can be used for (i) collaborative
interactive notebooks, (ii) extending its functionality from within itself, and (iii)
developing reprogrammable applications.},

for introducing young children to programming. However, mastery of text-based programming
continues to be the educational goal for students who continue to program into their
teenage years and beyond. Transitioning across the significant gap between the two
editing styles presents a difficult challenge in school-level teaching of programming.
We propose a new style of program manipulation to bridge the gap: frame-based editing.
Frame-based editing has the resistance to errors and approachability of block-based
programming while retaining the flexibility and more conventional programming semantics
of text-based programming languages. In this paper, we analyse the issues involved
in the transition from blocks to text and argue that they can be overcome by using
frame-based editing as an intermediate step. A design and implementation of a frame-based
editor is provided.},

We model scenarios of CX while we abstract from technological spaces and application domains. Our objective is to mediate between universal consistency properties of CX and test-driven validation of concrete (illustrative) CX implementations. To this end, we leverage an emerging megamodeling language LAL which is based on many- and order-sorted predicate logic with support for reuse by inlining modulo substitution. We provide a simple translation semantics for LAL so that formulae can be rendered as test cases on appropriate interpretations of the megamodel elements. Our approach has been implemented and validated in logic programming; this includes the executable language definition of LAL and test-case execution on top of illustrative CX implementations.},

For programming to be more fluid, editing and debugging should occur concurrently as live programming. This paper describes how live execution feedback can be woven into the editor by making places in program execution, not just code, navigable so that evaluation results can be probed directly within the code editor. A pane aside the editor also traces execution with entries that are similarly navigable, enabling quick problem diagnosis. Both probes and traces are refreshed continuously during editing, and are easily configured based on debugging needs. We demonstrate the usefulness of this live programming experience with a prototype.},

Despite the remarkable success of dataframe libraries in R and Python, dataframes face performance issues even on moderately large datasets. Moreover, there is significant ambiguity regarding dataframe semantics. In this paper we lay out a vision and roadmap for scalable dataframe systems. To demonstrate the potential in this area, we report on our experience building Modin, a scaled-up implementation of the most widely-used and complex dataframe API today, Python's pandas. With pandas as a reference, we propose a simple data model and algebra for dataframes to ground discussion in the field. Given this foundation, we lay out an agenda of open research opportunities where the distinct features of dataframes will require extending the state of the art in many dimensions of data management. We discuss the implications of signature dataframe features including flexible schemas, ordering, row/column equivalence, and data/metadata fluidity, as well as the piecemeal, trial-and-error-based approach to interacting with dataframes.},

Changes introduced in a model may trigger inconsistencies between the model and its run-time state (e.g., deleting the current state in a statemachine); effectively requiring to migrate the run-time state to comply with the updated model. In this paper, we introduce an approach that enables to automatically migrate such run-time state based on declarative constraints defined by the language designer. We illustrate the approach using Nextep, a meta-modeling language for defining invariants and migration constraints on run-time state models. When a model changes, Nextep employs model finding techniques, backed by a solver, to automatically infer a new run-time model that satisfies the declared constraints. We apply Nextep to define migration strategies for two DSLs, and report on its expressiveness and performance.},

  abstract   = {Representing programs as text strings makes programming harder then it has to be. The source text of a program is far removed from its behavior. Bridging this conceptual gulf is what makes programming so inhumanly difficult -- we are not compilers. Subtext is a new medium in which the representation of a program is the same thing as its execution. Like a spreadsheet, a program is visible and alive, constantly executing even as it is edited. Program edits are coherent semantic transformations.The essence of this new medium is copying. Programs are constructed by copying and executed by copy flow: the projection of changes through copies. The simple idea of copying develops into a rich theory of higher-order continual copying of trees. Notably absent are symbolic names, the workhorse of textual notation, replaced by immediately-bound explicit relationships. Subtext unifies traditionally distinct programming tools and concepts, and enables some novel ones. Ancestral structures are a new primitive data type that combines the features of lists and records, along with unproblematic multiple inheritance. Adaptive conditionals use first-class program edits to dynamically adapt behavior.A prototype implementation shows promise, but calls for much further research. Subtext suggests that we can make programming radically easier, if we are willing to be radical.},

algorithms, which support the proposed consistency model, are devised and discussed
in detail. In particular, we have contributed (1) a novel generic operation transformation
control algorithm for achieving intention preservation in combination with schemes
for achieving convergence and causality preservation and (2) a pair of reversible
inclusion and exclusion transformation algorithms for stringwise operations for text
editing. An Internet-based prototype system has been built to test the feasibility

For example, if a data scientist performs an analysis in 2017 that saves a significant amount of money, then she will likely to be asked to perform the same analysis on data from 2018. But more data analyses means more effort spent in data wrangling. We introduce the data diff problem, which attempts to turn this problem into an opportunity. Comparing the repeated data samples against each other, inconsistencies may be indicative of underlying issues in data quality. By analogy to text textttdiff, the data diff problem is to find a "patch", that is, transformation in a specified domain-specific language, that transforms the data samples so that they are identically distributed. We present a prototype tool for data diff that formalizes the problem as a bipartite matching problem, calibrating its parameters using a bootstrap procedure. The tool is evaluated quantitatively and through a case study on an open government data set.},

We show that tranquility is easier to obtain and less disruptive for the running application but still a sufficient condition to ensure application consistency.

Therefore, the identify of elements is not stable across different versions of the same model. Existing model differencing algorithms, therefore, cannot be applied directly because they need to identify model elements across versions. In this paper we present Textual Model Diff (tmdiff), a technique to support model differencing for textual languages. tmdiff requires origin tracking during text-to-model mapping to trace model elements back to the symbolic names that define them in the textual representation. Based on textual alignment of those names, tmdiff can then determine which elements are the same across revisions, and which are added or removed. As a result, tmdiff brings the benefits of model differencing to textual languages.},

To enjoy its benefits, programmers need powerful languages and live programming environments for understanding the effects of code modifications on running programs. Unfortunately, the enabling technology that powers these languages, is missing. Change, a crucial enabler for explorative coding, omniscient debugging and version control, is a potential solution.
               We aim to deliver generic solutions for creating these languages, in particular Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). We present Cascade, a meta-language for expressing DSLs with interface- and feedback-mechanisms that drive live programming. We demonstrate run-time migrations, ripple effects and live desugaring of three existing DSLs. Our results show that an explicit representation of change is instrumental for how these languages are built, and that cause-and-effect relationships are vital for delivering precise feedback.},

It provides developers with object-oriented data modeling concepts but abstracts over implementation details for persisting application data in relational databases. When the underlying data model of an application evolves, persisted application data has to be migrated. While implementing migration at the database level breaks the abstractions provided by WebDSL, an implementation at the data model level requires to intermingle migration with application code. In this paper, we present a domain-specific language for the coupled evolution of data models and application data. It allows to specify data model evolution as a separate concern at the data model level and can be compiled to migration code at the database level. Its linguistic integration with WebDSL enables static checks for evolution validity and correctness.},

  abstract  = {Many programs that interact with a database need to undergo schema refactoring several times during their life cycle. Since this process typically requires making significant changes to the program's implementation, schema refactoring is often non-trivial and error-prone. Motivated by this problem, we propose a new technique for automatically synthesizing a new version of a database program given its original version and the source and target schemas. Our method does not require manual user guidance and ensures that the synthesized program is equivalent to the original one. Furthermore, our method is quite efficient and can synthesize new versions of database programs (containing up to 263 functions) that are extracted from real-world web applications with an average synthesis time of 69.4 seconds.},

  abstract   = {This paper presents a new technique for migrating data between different schemas. Our method expresses the schema mapping as a Datalog program and automatically synthesizes a Datalog program from simple input-output examples to perform data migration. This approach can transform data between different types of schemas (e.g., relational-tograph, document-to-relational) and performs synthesis efficiently by leveraging the semantics of Datalog. We implement the proposed technique as a tool called Dynamite and show its effectiveness by evaluating Dynamite on 28 realistic data migration scenarios.},
